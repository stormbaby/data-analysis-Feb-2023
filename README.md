From the analysis I have arrived at two conclusions about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

The success of a theater's outcome overall didn't depend on the month of the launch.
Very few of the theater's outcomes failed.
I concluded that if the goal was less than 20,000 there was a reasonable probably that the outcome would be successful.

Some limitations of this dataset would be

The Launch date used didn't include the year.
The data didn't show what the words successful and failed meant. That data could have been broken up more to see gradients.
Another possible table and/or graph that we could create would be

A pie chart. We could have the outcomes ( Successful, Failure etc) as pieces of the pie.
